# Project Description 

This dashboard was completed as an interactive aid for the research and visualizations I helped produce for the Mecklenburg County Strategic Planning process report, "Identifying Opportunities to Improve Access, Coordination, and Quality in the Behavioral Health System in Mecklenburg County: A Gap Analysis Report". The report seeks to assess the behavioral healthcare service delivery system in Mecklenburg County and identify potential gaps in services. This dashboards identifies patterns in service utilization using descriptive analyses from large-scale datasets and complements the strategic plan report. 

This dashboard also covers the  Provider Distribution section, which was spearheaded by me to visualize how providers are disperesed across the 35 uniques zip codes and 11 different cities that make up Mecklenburg County.
