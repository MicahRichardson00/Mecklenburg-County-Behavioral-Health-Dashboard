# Project Description 

This dashboard was completed as an interactive aid for the research and visualizations I helped produce for the Mecklenburg County Strategic Planning process report, Identifying Opportunities to Improve Access, Coordination, and Quality in the Behavioral Health System in Mecklenburg County: A Gap Analysis Report. The report seeks to assess the behavioral healthcare service delivery system in Mecklenburg County and identify potential gaps in services. This dashboards identifies patterns in service utilization using descriptive analyses from large-scale datasets and complements the strategic plan report.

This dashboard also covers the Provider Distribution section, which was spearheaded by me to visualize how providers are dispersed across the 35 unique zip codes and 11 different cities that make up Mecklenburg County.

# Data Preparation 

The data for this dashboard was compiled from a variety of different sources including: The American Community Survey, U.S Census Bureau, Mecklenburg County Government, and the National Provider Index Registry. From Mecklenburg County's data portal, I downloaded the shapefile to get the boundaries for the Tableau map as well as the list of zip codes within the county. I then ran multiple join statements on the file with the previously mentioned data sources to get a combined table that included zip code, shapefile information, median household income, demographic data, and insurance usage.

# Future Plans

As the original gap analysis report is evolving, my dashboard will also be evolving by continuing to add new visualizations. Some potential dashboard additions include a finalized service utilization rate map for the county and access to care heat maps by zip codes. Once research is finished being conducted and permission is given to use some of the additional data sources, I will add those views for further analysis.
